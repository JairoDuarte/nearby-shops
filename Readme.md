# Coding Challenge
> The coding challenge is about implementing an app that lists shops nearby, help users to find shops that are near their location **HTML5 Geolocation**. and they can dislike or like shop to add on preferred list and remove them from preferred.


#### For the testing purpose, you can use the following user:

>email: **alfredojairo17@gmail.com** 
password: **alfredojairo17@gmail.com**

Technical spec
---------------
Application is split between a **back-end** and a **web front-end**.

The **front-end** is a single page app with a single index.html, building with **VueJS**. 

The **back-end** is a **REST API** building with **NodeJS**,  **adonisJS web framework** and **MongoDB**.,

Getting Started
---------------
> Development

To run the app on localhost, just clone the project and run ```npm install``` in backend and frontend folder. After that you can run the backend API by running the command ```npm start ``` and launch frontend server using ``` npm start``` again. Now you can access App by typing htpp://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can run the api test, just config .env.testing file for your environment 

> Production

To run the app on localhost like production environment, just clone the project and run ``` npm install ``` for backend and frontend folder. After in frontend folder run ```npm  run build ``` and backend run npm start.

Architecture
---------------

The backend API also use Google Maps api to search and sorted shops nearby by distance the connect user.

``` Backend ```

The main logic of app is based in [adonisjs](https://adonisjs.com/). The database ORM is [Lucid Mongo](https://github.com/duyluonglc/lucid-mongo). The code is written in JavaScript.
